# Hello!  

My name is Lucas, and I love to make people feel good. In this profile, you will find several Android and GameDev related projects, since these are my main development focuses.

I really hope that you enjoy this space.

Feel free to get in touch!

## Legacy Profile

I have another GitHub profile with several projects from College, and some random others that I did back in the day. [Feel free to also visit it!](https://github.com/lupcorrea)
